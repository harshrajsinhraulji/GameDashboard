## Styleguides

### JavaScript
-   Follow standard vanilla JavaScript conventions.
-   Keep game logic encapsulated within its own module (`/games/gamename/`).
-   Comment any complex or non-obvious parts of your code.

### PHP
-   All backend code must be secure.
-   All database interactions **must** use prepared statements with PDO or MySQLi to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
-   Ensure API responses are in a consistent JSON format.

Thank you again for your interest in making the Game Dashboard even better!!
