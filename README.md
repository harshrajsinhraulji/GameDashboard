## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need a local server environment with PHP and MySQL. The easiest way to get this is by installing a package like:
- [WampServer](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) (for Windows)
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) (for Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp/) (for macOS)

### Installation

1.  **Download the Code:** Place all the project files into a folder named `game-dashboard`.
2.  **Move to Server Directory:** Move the `game-dashboard` folder into your server's web root.
    - For WAMP, this is typically `C:/wamp64/www/`.
    - For XAMPP, this is typically `C:/xampp/htdocs/`.
3.  **Start Your Server:** Launch WAMP/XAMPP and make sure both the Apache and MySQL services are running.
4.  **Set Up the Database:** Follow the database setup instructions below.
5.  **Access the Application:** Open your web browser and navigate to **`http://localhost/game-dashboard/`**.

### Database Setup

You must create the database and tables for the application to function.

1.  Navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/` in your browser.
2.  Click on the **SQL** tab.
3.  Copy the entire SQL script below and paste it into the query box.
4.  Click **Go** to execute the script. This will create the `game_dashboard` database, all necessary tables, and pre-load the games.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS game_dashboard CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
USE game_dashboard;

CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE games (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE scores (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  game_id INT NOT NULL,
  score INT NOT NULL,
  played_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (game_id) REFERENCES games(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Seed the games table with the 5 games
INSERT INTO games (name) VALUES
('Snake'),
('2048'),
('Minesweeper'),
('Memory'),
('Reaction');
```
## üìÇ Project Structure
The project uses a modular structure to separate concerns and make it easy to add new games.
```
